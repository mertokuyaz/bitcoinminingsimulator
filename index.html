            <strong>Did you know?</strong> In 2009, 3 hours of mining on a home PC could have earned ~100 BTC, worth over <strong>$5 Million USD</strong> today.
            <br>
            The 'Extreme' setting here is inspired by that era so you can actually find a block and have a feel of how it was at 2009!

            <h2>What is SHA-256?</h2>
            <p>
                SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. This output is a unique, fixed-size string of characters, often represented as a 64-character hexadecimal string.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crucially, SHA-256 is a <strong>one-way algorithm</strong>. This means it's easy to compute a hash from an input, but virtually impossible to reverse the process to find the input from its hash. The only way to find a specific hash is through brute-force—trying endless combinations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Bitcoin mining, miners combine the block data (previous hash, Merkle root, timestamp) with a 'nonce'. They hash this combined data, and if the output doesn't meet the difficulty target, they change the nonce and try again. This brute-force process is the essence of Proof-of-Work.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can experiment with SHA-256 yourself using this online tool: <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SHA-256 Online Tool</a>.

            <h2>How Bitcoin Mining Works</h2>
            <p>
                Think of Bitcoin mining as a giant, competitive lottery where miners try to find a "winning number" to validate a new block of transactions. This process, called <strong>Proof-of-Work</strong>, secures the network without a central authority.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Block:</strong> A collection of recent, unconfirmed transactions. Miners gather these into a potential block.</li>
                <li><strong>The Hash:</strong> A miner takes the block's header data (including a reference to the previous block's hash and a "Merkle Root" summarizing all transactions) and runs it through a one-way function called <strong>SHA-256</strong>. This produces a unique, fixed-length digital fingerprint called a "hash".</li>
                <li><strong>The Nonce:</strong> Since the block data is fixed, miners add a special number called a <code>nonce</code> (number used once). They can change this nonce millions of times per second. Even a tiny change to the nonce results in a completely different hash.</li>
                <li><strong>The Difficulty Target:</strong> The Bitcoin network sets a "difficulty target". To win, a miner must find a hash that is numerically <em>less than</em> this target. This is represented here as a required number of leading zeros (e.g., <code>00000...</code>). More zeros means a smaller target number, which is much harder to find.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Miners repeatedly change the <code>nonce</code>, calculate a new hash, and check if it meets the target. The first one to find a valid hash broadcasts their solution, wins the block reward (newly minted bitcoin), and the global lottery starts over for the next block.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card explanation-card">
            <h2>How This Simulator Works</h2>
            <p>
                This tool mimics the core "guessing" loop of the mining process right in your browser.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Block Data:</strong> The text in this box simulates the data a miner would hash. You can change it to see how it affects the final hash.</li>
                <li><strong>Nonce (Behind the Scenes):</strong> When you click "Start Mining," the script starts at <code>nonce = 0</code>. It combines this nonce with the Block Data and calculates the SHA-256 hash.</li>
                <li><strong>The Loop:</strong> If the hash doesn't meet the selected <strong>Difficulty</strong>, it increments the nonce (0, 1, 2, 3...) and tries again, thousands of times per second.</li>
                <li><strong>Hashes/sec:</strong> This metric shows how fast your computer is performing this guess-and-check loop. Real Bitcoin miners use specialized hardware (ASICs) that can perform trillions of hashes per second.</li>
                <li><strong>ETA:</strong> Based on the current hash rate, this gives a statistical estimate of how long it might take to find a winning hash, as the probability of finding a valid hash is based on the difficulty.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <strong>Extreme (7)</strong> difficulty setting gives a taste of the "golden age" of CPU mining around 2009. The original block reward was <strong>50 BTC</strong>. With so few people on the network, it was theoretically possible for a hobbyist with a mediocre PC to solve a couple of blocks in just a few hours. That 3 hours of proof-of-work could have earned them 100 BTC, worth around <strong>$5 million</strong> at today's prices.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card explanation-card">
            <h2>Current Bitcoin Mining Reality (2024)</h2>
            <p>
                While this simulator lets you experience mining with just a few leading zeros, <strong>real Bitcoin mining today requires finding hashes with at least 17-18 leading zeros</strong>. This represents an astronomical increase in difficulty since Bitcoin's early days.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impossible for Solo Mining:</strong> The current difficulty is so high that even the most powerful consumer hardware would take thousands of years to find a single valid block.</li>
                <li><strong>CPU/GPU Mining is Dead:</strong> Regular computer processors and graphics cards are completely obsolete for Bitcoin mining. They simply cannot compete with the hash rates required.</li>
                <li><strong>ASIC Machines Only:</strong> Today's Bitcoin miners use specialized hardware called ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) that are designed exclusively for SHA-256 hashing. These machines can perform hundreds of terahashes per second.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Scale:</strong> Modern Bitcoin mining operations are massive industrial facilities with thousands of ASIC machines, consuming megawatts of electricity and requiring sophisticated cooling systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks are found approximately every 10 minutes regardless of the total network hash rate. As more powerful mining equipment joins the network, the difficulty automatically increases to maintain this timing. This is why Bitcoin mining has evolved from a hobby anyone could do on their laptop to a highly specialized industrial operation.
